## How I Worked on this Project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
👩🏻‍💻.

- I created this application based on [Figma designs](https://figma.com/file/NMGd0gAgQzgpauqhs1vzNG/Figmaland--Business-Landing-page-%28Community%29?node-id=69%3A5241) obtained from [Captain Design](https://captain-design.com), trying to implement the concept of 'Pixel Perfect'.

- I separated each requirement into sub-tasks

- Wrote maintainable code and commented out sections that required it

- Used pure CSS and vanilla JS

- Published my code with descriptive commits for each new feature

<br/>

## Sections and Features

- List of product benefits

- Form to subscribe to newsletter

- User reviews

- Subscriptions and their prices

- Contact section and company information

<br/>

## Dependencies

- Using [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for cross-browser style normalization

<br />

## How to navigate this project

- Logic for the opening and closing of the menu and its animation: [Code](https://github.com/OrnellaGrigolato/Figmaland-landing-page/blob/f3685b7e0718356a79e64c6bd1cc72493cb3c092/src/js.js#L16)

- Responsive CSS: [Code](https://github.com/OrnellaGrigolato/Figmaland-landing-page/blob/f3685b7e0718356a79e64c6bd1cc72493cb3c092/src/style.css#L270)

<br />

## Why I built the project this way ❔

I didn't use any component-based framework or library because for a simple landing page I don't consider it necessary. That would only overload the project, slowing it down. Also, I didn't think it was necessary to convert this project into a SPA because the navigation, in this case, is through a single file.
